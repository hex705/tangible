 * 
 *  ### How to use the google file 
 * 
 * -- please **COPY** the file if you want to edit it -- just view it otherwise. 
 * 
 * -- the colors may be helpful (?) for those of you starting out with code.
 * 
 *  ### Why am I doing it this way?
 * 
 * -- students do not learn anything about code if they just opening and run files.
 * 
 * -- but it is important that things work during class time!
 * 
 * -- the google file is a weak solve to a big issue of remote teaching: 
 *      -- how do I share code and develop it with you on a platfomr not designed 
 *         for sharing?
 *   
 * -- in class I will usually start on google doc and copy into ardiuno -- you will have 
 *    to do this too  
 *    
 * -- we will see how this goes -- it may be a disaster -- in which case we will 
 *    switch tactics. 
 * 
 * Finally -- **be patient with each other** 
 *  - with 30 people remote all at once, it is hard to troubleshoot 
 *    code and circuits!  
 *
